# Iter

*Iter* comes from the Latin for "travel". The goal is to produce a LLM backed travel itinerary creator, frontend and backend, then see what we can link it to.

### Progress and TODOs:

* Backend
  * User Login
  * Embedding Service
  * Middleware
  * Database
  * Chat Service
  * Chat Service (Streaming)
  * Scrape Content
  * Embed Content
  * Routing
  * Integration with booking service (if I stick with this)
  * Geolocation
  * Instagram search?
  * Stateful chat
  * Map generation
  * Saving the itinerary
 
* Frontend
  * Home Page
  * Log In Page
  * Itinerary Creator (given destination, wants, time)
  * Destination suggestion
  * Blogging functionality - let people submit their own itineraries and vote on them
  * Images
